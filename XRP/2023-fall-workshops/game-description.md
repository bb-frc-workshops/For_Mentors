# eXtreme Robot Pizza (XRP) Party

## 1. Game Overview

You and your alliance own a pizza shop run by XRP botos. Your goal every round is to assembly 4 pizza slices with sauce, cheese and optional toppings and place them in the oven. Then get ready for the next customer by cleaning up your kitchen space and returning to the counter for the next customer.

Each match begins with a 15-second autonomous period, during which time alliance robots operate only on pre-programmed instructions to score points by:

* Leaving the counter/home area
* Pre-heating the oven by stopping in the Oven Control zone

In the final 2 minutes and 15 seconds of the match, drivers take control of their robots and score points by:

* Putting ingredients on each of their pizza slices
* Returning to the counter before the end of the match

The alliance with the highest score at the end of the match wins!
